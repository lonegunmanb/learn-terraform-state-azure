# Learn Terraform State Management

The repo has been re-written with AzureRM provider. Due to the difference between Azure and Aws, it's imposibble to follow the [Move a resource to a different state file](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/state-cli#move-a-resource-to-a-different-state-file) chapter by moving one resource, so the reader could just skip this chapter.

This repo is a companion repo to the [Learn Terraform State Management](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/state/state-cli) tutorial.
It contains Terraform configuration you can use to learn how to create an AWS instance and security group, examine a state file, and then manipulate resources to observe how vital state is to your Terraform operations.
